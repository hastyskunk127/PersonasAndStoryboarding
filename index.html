					<h2> Background </h2>
					<p class="caption">The CVS on the corner of Thayer and Cushing St is one of the most frequented stores around Brown University's campus, with high schoolers, college students, and others regularly paying it a visit. Many customers choose to check out using one of three self-checkout machines by the store. From talking to others, and from my personal experience, there seemed to be something less than ideal about the checkout experience, which prompted me to do a more in depth exploration of the user experience with the checkout machine, to hopefully get a better sense of its design as well as what its users are and what their experiences with it are.</p>

					<h2 class="division-title">What We Saw</h2>
					<ul class="list-no-bullets">
						<li>The users seemed to move rather quickly through the interface, making it past the scanning items page rather automatically, with most taking between one and two minutes total.</li> <br>
						<li>Two pages took users longer on average to get past, the first being the screen for selecting payment options the second being the screen for donating rounding up to charity. These seemed to be the screens where the users appeared to be reading the screen instructions instead of interacting from rote memory.</li> <br>
						<li>One of the users brought coupons, and seemed the most comfortable with the interface relative to the other two.</li> <br>
						<li>Two users looked up their phone numbers for discounts.</li><br>

					<h4>Key Take-Aways From Their Responses</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The users all responded that they operated the self-checkout mostly by muscle memory, and knew to start scanning and bagging their items from experience rather than from reading instructions. </li>
						<li>The overall experience seemed rather easy for the users (two rated their experience 4 - Good, one rated it 2 - Meh). A common thread was finding the process rather quick but the actual layout rather ugly, with one noting that they didn't feel the button colors or placement was helpful. The user who had came prepared with coupons was most positive about the experience, but found some parts of the check-out that were meant to assist new users (audio cues for placing the scanned item in the bagging area, for example) to be annoying after frequent use.</li>
						<li> Two users were caught off guard by the scan coupon and rounding up screen and had expected the next screen after the scanning screen to be the payment screen â€” both found the distance between the ROUND UP and NO button to be too large, and thought the buttons should be different colors.</li>
						<li> All users said they choose check-out upwards of 90%, citing feeling anti-social and finding self-checkout to be faster.</li>
						<li> All three said they would not, with one highlighting the scanning screen where "use my own bag" and "finish and pay" were both green as an example of confusion.</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="col">
					<h2 class="division-title">What They Said</h2>
					<h4>Questions We Asked</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>What was your initial reaction upon seeing the first screen to pop up once you started scanning?</li>
						<li>How would you rate your checkout experience on a scale of 0 to 5, 0 being terrible and 5 being great, and why?</li>
						<li>Initial reaction to rounding up screen?</li>
						<li>What percentage of the time would you say you use the self-checkout compared to in-person checkout; why?</li>
						<li>If there was no text do you think you'd be able to check out your purchased items?</li>
					</ol>

						<li>Lucy wants to get through the checkout process as quickly as possible, and finds a lot of the options on the screen distracting. She is caught off guard by the screen asking her to scan coupons and the one asking for donation that pop up after she clicks "Finish and Pay", and when the pay screen pops up she hesitates because two of the buttons include the word "Credit" and don't have clear reasoning behind their color or layout.</li><br>
						<li>Two of my users went to CVS semi-frequently, but often would pop by rather spontaneously to pick something up for the short-term (a snack, some item they need for that night, etc). As a result they wanted to get through the experience as soon as possible, and were caught off guard when certain parts of the UI caught them off guard - in particular, the unexpected donation screen, and the fact that the "Use my own Bag" and "Finish and Pay" buttons were both green and beside each other.</li>

						<li>Carly comes to CVS well-prepared - they know what they want to buy and have coupons with them to buy it. They're very familiar with the interface and the buttons that pop up, but are annoyed by the occasionally faulty weight sensor, and the fact that it doesn't let them progress until it detects that the scanned item has been placed in the baggy area.</li><br>
						<li>One of my users was a frequent shopper at CVS and was familiar with the different screens, but potentially because they were so used to the layout they found some of the unskippable features that were meant to help new users frustrating (the audio cue to place scanned items in the shopping area, etc.)</li>
